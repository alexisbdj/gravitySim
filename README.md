# GravitySim

Simulates gravity using scaled distances to fit float numbers and **raylib** for rendering.

I wanted to test raylib for a simple and quick project.

the project it self works but I thought about possible improvements :
- describe scenes using JSON
- simulate collisions
- interact with the scene
